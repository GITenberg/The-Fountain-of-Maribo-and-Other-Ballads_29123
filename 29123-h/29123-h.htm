&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The long night all</i>&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Wherefore, O Queen, has sent for me?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;m passion&rsquo;s thrall</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as e&rsquo;er my lord is dead,<br />

12</span>RAMUND</h2>
<p>Ramund thought he should a better man be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If better apparel arrayed him;<br />
Of garments of leather, and hemp patch&rsquo;d together,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Queen then a present made him.<br />
&ldquo;These I will not wear,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They beseem me not fair,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your garments of tow and leather bestow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the cleaners of trencher and platter.&rdquo;<br
/>
The Lady to give him fresh clothes was not slow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of sammet and silk were the latter.<br />
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;Yes, these will I wear,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They beseem me right fair,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund he into the shop now hies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the best of all tailors was sitting:<br />
&ldquo;Now wilt thou, O tailor, so dext&rsquo;rous and wise,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make clothes for Ramund fitting?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And why should I not?&rdquo; the tailor he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then thou&rsquo;lt do well I wot,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice twenty-five ells for the breeches take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen for the points of the breeches;<br />
And them thou must strong and durable make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou therein settest stitches.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;These are too tight,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stride out aright,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Now Ramund his ships beside the shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With everything needful prepareth;<br />
And away, away, the salt ocean o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the land of the Jutuns he beareth.<br />
&ldquo;We are come to this soil,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And withouten much toil,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund he wanders along the strand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There seven tall Giants faced him:<br />
&ldquo;If I take Ramund in my left hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I afar from the land will cast him.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not do that alone,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye must come every one,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund drew out his trusty glaive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which Dymling for name he had given;<br />
And dead to the earth with seven blows brave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hewed the Jotuns seven.<br />
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;There ye all seven lie,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And still living am I,&rdquo; said Ramund the
young.</p>
<p>Ramund walked on till the big Jutt he spied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to see him he sorely wonder&rsquo;d;<br />
For full fifty ells was his carcase wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his height was nearly a hundred.<br />
&ldquo;What a breadth, what a height!&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost wish for a fight?&rdquo; said Ramund the
young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Ramund, if thou wilt let me live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to me no damage wilt proffer,<br />
I&rsquo;ll bathe thee in wine, and to thee I will give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven bushels of gold from my coffer.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em eight, if you will,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will cut thee down still,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The first, first day that together they fought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their naked fists they contested;<br />
Then Ramund he hold of the Jutt&rsquo;s beard caught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the flesh from the teeth he wrested.<br />
&ldquo;Thou grinnest full evil, bold Ramund,&rdquo; he said,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou look&rsquo;st worse than the
Devil,&rdquo; said Ramund the young.</p>
<p>Next day they set to at the rise of the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again with a rage unexampled;<br />
The huge stone mountain they stood upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the earth &rsquo;neath their feet was
trampled.<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis hard sport, I swear!&rdquo; the giant he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We began but this year,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Then Ramund again to his sword recurred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which Dymling for name he had given;<br />
And the head of the Jutt, which no ox could have stirred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hewed high unto the heaven.<br />
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould not cut well I thought,&rdquo; bold
Ramund he said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet it cut as it ought,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund he into the mountain strode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the small trolds house were keeping;<br />
The tears fast down their visages flow&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Ramund they fell to weeping.<br />
&ldquo;Do ye weep for me,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er weep for ye,&rdquo;
said Ramund the young.</p>
<p>Now Ramund behold is dealing his blows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Kemps most famed for fighting;<br />
About and around in the cave he goes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the earth the demons smiting.<br />
&ldquo;I rule here at my ease,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And can do what I please,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>On his ship entered he so vehemently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That it cracked his vehemence under;<br />
In the ship the men all began loudly to bawl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thought they should certainly founder.<br />
&ldquo;We shall not sink here,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So ye need not to fear,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Now Ramund he straight seven ships did freight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the gold which the Trolds had hoarded;<br />
Then across the tide to the land he hied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er which the Emperor lorded.<br />
&ldquo;To this land we are come,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We no farther will roam,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>On the white sand Ramund his anchor flung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The high prow strandward turning;<br />
And the very first man to land that sprung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was himself, with eagerness burning.<br />
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Now do nothing more,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;All labour give o&rsquo;er,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p>To the Ball-house he sped, where the kempions play&rsquo;d<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At ball with glee and vigour;<br />
But at his coming all stood adread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sight of so fierce a figure.<br />
&ldquo;Pretty sport is this same,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make one in the game,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p>With fear and dismay upon his brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From a window the Emperor gazes:<br />
&ldquo;O who is that man in the yard below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes such horrible faces?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I, and with glee,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do battle with thee,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Ramund he struck on his sword amain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth to its centre trembled;<br />
The small birds swooned and fell on the plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the bough that were singing assembled.<br />
&ldquo;Come down to me, knave,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or by God I shall rave,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund he into the door now trode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face like a burning ember:<br />
&ldquo;Though iron and steel oppose my road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll penetrate to his chamber.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Now be on thy guard,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to strike hard,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>
<p>On the door Ramund smote with an iron bar stout,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The castle was rent and parted;<br />
&rsquo;Neath that blow&rsquo;s power nod wall and tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From their place the windows started.<br />
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;You see I broke in,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now at stake is thy skin,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Ramund, dear Ramund, my life now spare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with benefits thee I&rsquo;ll cover;<br />
I&rsquo;ll give thee my youngest daughter fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the half of the land I rule over.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Can take all any tide,&rdquo; bold Ramund he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And thy daughter beside,&rdquo; said Ramund
the young.</p>
<p>Ramund then drew out Dymling his blade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his valour the trusty assistant;<br />
And he hewed at the Emperor so that his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flew fifteen furlongs distant.<br />
&ldquo;I thought &rsquo;twould not sever,&rdquo; bold Ramund he
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But the blood runs however,&rdquo; said
Ramund the young.</p>

22</span>ALF OF ODDERSKIER</h2>
<p>Alf he dwells at Odderskier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is rich and bold withal;<br />
Two stout and stalwart sons has he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom men do kempions call.</p>
<p>Yes, two stout sons of mighty fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Alf of Odderskier;<br />
Of the king who dwells on Upsal fells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They love the daughter fair.</p>
<p>It was youthful Helmer Kamp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From stall his courser led;<br />
&ldquo;O I will hie me up the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the king&rsquo;s fair daughter wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>It was youthful Angelfyr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sprang on his courser&rsquo;s back:<br />
&ldquo;And I will ride to Upsal too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the earth beneath me crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they entered the castle yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They doffed their cloaks of skin;<br />
Then straight they strode to the high, high hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the monarch of Upsal in.</p>
<p>In came youthful Helmer Kamp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With grace and beauty rife:<br />
&ldquo;O King, thy daughter dear I love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilt give her me for wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In came youthful Angelfyr,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His steely helmet shone:<br />
&ldquo;O King, give up thy daughter to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And straight from the land begone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered soon the Upsal-King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a brave reply he gave:<br />
&ldquo;On my daughter I&rsquo;ll no husband force,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll choose whom she will have.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Now many thanks, dear father, that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou leav&rsquo;st the choice to me;<br />
I&rsquo;ll plight me to young Helmer Kamp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s like a man to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not have young Angelfyr,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an ugly Trold to view;<br />
His father so is, his mother so is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So are all his kindred too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered the young Angelfyr,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sorely wroth he grew:<br />
&ldquo;Come, brother, come to the court-yard down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her we will battle do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spake the Upsal King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Upsal King did say:<br />
&ldquo;The swords are sharp, the swains are stark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be, I trow, good play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alf he stands at Odderskier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he listens the mountains tow&rsquo;rds;<br />
Then must he hear so far, far off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clash of his children&rsquo;s swords.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>And that heard Alf of Odderskier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So far across the down:<br />
&ldquo;What have my sons now got in hand?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why so wrathful are they grown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tarried then so short a space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sprang on his courser red;<br />
And he arrived at Upsala<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before his sons lay dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, youthful Helmer Kamp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me my dearest son,<br />
Wherefore so free from thy flesh and bone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those bloody rivers run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered the young Helmer Kamp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he writhed him round with pain;<br />
This Angelfyr, my brother, has done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the maid he could not gain.</p>
<p>I have full fifteen mortal wounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are blent with poison all;<br />
But if I had only one of them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I dead full soon must fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Now list to me, young Angelfyr,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beloved son of mine;<br />
Say, wherefore trembles so the sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that good hand of thine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask&rsquo;st thou why trembles so the sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this right hand of mine?<br />
Because I&rsquo;ve eighteen mortal wounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to hurt me they combine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have full eighteen mortal wounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And each so deadly sore;<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
